# OCR2QR
The goal is to automate a system that generates QR codes that links to coded text extracted from an image.

camera.py simply allows you to open the native camera interface. I'm using the 1080P HD Night Vision IR Surveillance Camera Module Board 5MP For Raspberry Pi.

ocr2qr.py is the code to run optical character recognition on text and generate a QR code. This code still needs further refinement and possibly additional functions.
